## Weight files for pretrained SkipResNet models.

This repository is intended to provide weight files for pretrained SkipResNet models.
Weight files will published as assets of the releases.

See [reference implementation](https://github.com/takedarts/skipresnet-reference), if you would like use SkipResNets for your tasks.

See [evaluation results](https://github.com/takedarts/skipresnet), if you would like know the performances of SkipResNets.
